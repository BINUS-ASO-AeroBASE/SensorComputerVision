🖼️ OpenCV Detection Basics
Welcome to the OpenCV Detection Basics project!
Here, you'll learn how to perform basic detection tasks using OpenCV, including detecting general objects, finding windows or shapes, and detecting specific colors.

📚 What You Will Learn
Basic object detection using contours

Window (rectangle) detection

Color detection using HSV color space

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python)

Install OpenCV if you haven't yet:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python
